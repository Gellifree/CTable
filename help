NAME
		CTable - Terminal based timetable manager
		Version: 1.0

DESCRIPTION
		A program designed for managing timetables securely, and collecting information from them.
		Helping a group to organize events, based on their members free time.

		In this version, the program is optimized for University student groups.
			>> You can only store simplified versions of the timetables,
			   - 6 lesson, on 6 days [6x6 format]
			>> You can not give special timeframe for a lesson.
			   - If the timetable you try to store contains special lessons with different timeframes -
			   
			     Try to make it as close as posibble to the original
			     	-- If the lessons timeframe is smaller than usual, you have nothing to do --
			     	   just give it as [P]ractice, [L]ecture or [W]ork normally.

			     	-- If the lessons timeframe is bigger than usual, you have to decide how much is the 'overlap' --
			     	   If its overlapping more than half of the other lesson timeframe
			     	   		- Mark the other lesson as the overlapping one
			     	   If its overlapping less than half of the other lesson timeframe
			     	   		- Mark the other lesson as empty [0] at your own risk. 

						-- WARNING:
						If you want to make sure, the program always shows the people who surely have time,
						than mark the other lesson as the overlapping one. --
